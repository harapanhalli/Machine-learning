		And now a day, we can interact with websites that are like, comment, upload, and share the data which means a massive amount of data. So to handle this massive data we need a sophisticated data infrastructure, like Map-reduce and spark that provides a hike in big data. <br><br>So this rise in big data sparked the rise in data science just to support the needs of the business and 
		to draw insights from large unstructured data sets, and which is practiced using ML. So the machine learning provides the power to the normal systems with the ability to learn and improve by itself from its past experience without explicitly being coded/programmed. <br><br>And this article deal with the top 10 data science algorithms, to understand these algorithms<strong> we 
		need to understand the different types to which they belong, and it is explained below</strong>
	</p>

	<h3 class="display-3" style="font-size: 35px;">Types of a Machine learning algorithm</h3>
	<br><br>
	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-12"><h3>1. Supervised Learning </h3></dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-12"><p class="lead">
	In this, the labeled data is been provided for example let’s consider a mobile face unlock 
	system, wherein to train the mobile the facial pictures of the human are provided from all 
	angles, which is nothing but the labeled data. Then as a part of testing, we run a new 
	data/image through it, and if it is similar to the previous image that was provided while 
	training then it unlocks the mobile.
	</p></dd>
	<dl class="row" style="padding: 30px;">
		<h5 class="lead"><strong>So this uses two types of techniques</strong></h5>
		<dd class="col-sm-6"><p class="lead"><strong>Classification </strong><br>
		In this, it classifies the object concerning the class label and output will be 
		categorical that is yes/no or true/false </p></dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-6"><p class="lead"><strong>Regression </strong><br>
		Is commonly used when data is numerical in nature and when we want to predict a 
		answer. And thus it always provides a continuous output. Example predicting the 
		amount of rainfall, or a height of a person</p></dd>
	</dl>
	<br>
<dt class="col-sm-12"><h3>2. Unsupervised Learning  </h3></dt>
	<dd class="col-sm-12"><p class="lead">This is provided with unlabeled data, which is just a dataset with no label. So for instance, if a data set of the images of three different vegetables is provided, then from which it 
derives a pattern and categorizes the vegetable into three types based on the similarities. 
For example, an E-commerce website uses such a technique to figure out the product that 
is well suited for us</p></dd>
<dl class="row" style="padding: 30px;">
	<h5 class="lead"><strong>So this uses two types of techniques</strong></h5>
	<dd class="col-sm-6"><p class="lead"><strong>Clustering  </strong><br>
	Used to organize and find the pattern in the data such as in product 
recommendation</p></dd>
	<dd class="col-sm-6"><p class="lead"><strong> Associative analysis  </strong><br>
	Finds frequent co-occurrence and aims to find an interesting relationship between 
objects. That is it tries to discover that if a customer purchasing bread is likely to 
purchase jam.</p></dd>
</dl>

<dt class="col-sm-12"><h3>3. Reinforcement learning  </h3></dt>
	<dd class="col-sm-12"><p class="lead">Is not provided with any data, but learns from its previous experience. For example, a robot 
learning to go out of the class by trial and error method, so every time the robot hits a wall, 
trying to get out of class it learns from its mistake and tries out another option unless it 
reaches its goal.</p></dd>

	The above sentences describe, what are the three types of machine learning and by this, we can 
understand that choosing the right machine learning solution or the algorithm to be used, depends 
on these factors</p></dd>
